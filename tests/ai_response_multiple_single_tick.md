1. Open a terminal window.

2. Type the following command to start or restart Apache:
`sudo service apache2 start` or `sudo service apache2 restart`

3. You may be prompted to enter your password. Type it in and press Enter.

4. Apache should now start or restart. You can verify that it is running by typing the following command:
